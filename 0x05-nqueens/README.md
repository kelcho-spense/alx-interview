# N Queen challenge

The N queens puzzle is the challenge of placing N non-attacking queens on an N×N chessboard. Write a program that solves the N queens problem.

> Usage: **nqueens N**
>
> > If the user called the program with the wrong number of arguments, print **Usage: nqueens N**, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 1

> where N must be an integer greater or equal to 4
>
> > If N is not an integer, print **N must be a number**, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 1
> > If N is smaller than 4, print **N must be at least 4**, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 1

> The program should print every possible solution to the problem
>
> > One solution per line
> > Format: see example
> > You don’t have to print the solutions in a specific order

> You are only allowed to import the sys module
